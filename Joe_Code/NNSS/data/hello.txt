This array of booleans is then mapped to a new array of type float interleaved BPSK IQ data. Interleaved meaning I and Q are stored in repeating pairs of I, Q, I , Q, I, etc. The size of this array is equal to the number of bits in the bool array times the number of samples per symbol time two. We zero stuff samples per symbol number of times as later the matched RRC pulse shaping will spread the energy over these zeros creating a smooth transition between symbols for spectral efficiency and ISI prevention. For example if a series of IQ data at 1 sps looks like this [+1, -1, +1, -1] and is upsampled to 4 sps, the result would look like this with zero stuffing
